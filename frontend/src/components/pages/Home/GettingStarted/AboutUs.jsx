        <p className={styles.boxEffect}>
          Welcome to Analog Designs, your bridge to success in the mortgage
          industry. In a world where 85% of consumers conduct research online
          before making a purchase, and 74% turn to websites, a robust online
          presence is no longer optional; it's vital.
          <br />
          <br />
          We cater exclusively to mortgage brokers, crafting websites that lend
          credibility and distinction. Why? Because underwriters, like
          consumers, expect to find businesses online. If your brand doesn't
          appear in search results, it can raise questions about your
          reliability and even the legitimacy of your business.
          <br />
          <br />
          With Analog Designs, we create online experiences that not only
          captivate and engage but also build credibility. In 2019, there were
          approximately 3.8 million Google searches conducted each minute to
          find information on local businesses. Our designs ensure that you are
          a part of that statistic, solidifying your reputation as a
          trustworthy, reliable mortgage broker.
          <br />
          <br />
          Trust us to bridge the gap between your online presence and
          underwriters' expectations, ensuring a seamless mortgage approval
          process.
