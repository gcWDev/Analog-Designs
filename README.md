# Analog Desings 
The goal of this website is to provide mortgage brokers with an easy to use solution to generate websites for their clients who are missing an online presence for their business in their applications. After having built a couple websites of this kind for my mortgage broker friends, it seems like this is a legitimate business opportunity and I currently want to expand on it beyond the clientele of my social circle. Because the websites are intended solely for the purpose of income verification, I believe I can make 5+ design templates that componentize everything swapping assets, copyright, and typography to speed up the development process. Down the line I want to add user auth to allow brokers to checkup on their websites and have the functionality to take them offline after their application is approved, as opposed to me having to do it as they are responsible for the hosting fees.
## What problem does this solve? 
After having spoken to mortgage brokers on the bank side, an online presence is a checkbox they search for to amplify the legitimacy of the client in question. Having an online presence is hence key for borrowers that are just on the cusp of approval and brokers have no objections to paying a couple hundred dollars to further verify the legitimacy of their applicant.
## Goals 

Make a visually appealing design website so I can direct potential clients onto there as opposed to texting me directly 

Creating templates for different designs in react will make the process of creating the website much more efficient Down the line

Allowing users to create an account and give them the option to take the website offline will be less work for me, but will give me some experience working on backend code
## Technical breakdown 
I will use React, js, bootsrtap, vite, node js or python and MySQL for this project. The agency website will be in CSS because my theoretical grasp of CSS is lacking, and I want to improve it. A database will be useful in the future for user auth and to store previous projects, maybe also having an automated system to upload information about the applicantâ€™s company will be useful.
It will be deployed on nelify and I will explore my options in terms of hosting client websites as they require their own domain names and other miniscule logistics.
